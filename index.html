        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The following article walks you through the process of analyzing and identifying
          usability flaws in an existing interface, creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes 
          for various screen sizes, and building a responsive website based on those prototypes.

        <h3>Selecting an Interface</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to pick an interface that I knew very well and used quite often so that the 
          effort I would be putting into redesigning it would be well worth it and so that I had
          a sufficiently large dataset of usability concerns that I could try to solve.

        <h3>Addressing Usability Concerns</h3>
        <h4>The New User's Usability Concerns</h4>
        <p>
          This is someone who is either considering applying to Brown or a first/second year 
          student who wants to look at the expected workload for the Computer Science concentration.
          Learnability, i.e., how easy is the interface to use, is their primary concern. However, 
          the current concentration requirements webpage does not do a great job of addressing this 
          or working with the conceptual model of someone trying to understand the expected workload 
          for the Computer Science concentration. Let's look at some of the most glaring usability
          concerns and how we can address them. These slideshow frames have "buttons" at the bottom 
          that you can click to access different slides.

          This is a Brown student who is bored and wants to get a sense of what the 
          Computer Science concentration workload is like or a student who just declared and so
          doesn’t yet care too much about their requirements.  Memorability, i.e., how easy is 
          it to recall what to do, is their primary concern.  However, the current concentration
          requirements webpage does not do a great job of addressing this or working with the

          This is a Brown student who is a Computer Science concentrator. They have 
          visited the website many times and know how to get around. Their primary purpose is
          to see how many credits they need as well as what those credits are and they
          use this page as a single source of truth. Efficiency, i.e., how quickly can typical
          tasks be done, is their primary concern. However, the current concentration requirements
          webpage does not do a great job of addressing this or working with the conceptual model of 
          someone trying to make sure they will graduate on time. Let's look at some of the most

        <p>
          Lastly, we have a concern applicable to any kind of user. This one hinders Learnability,
          Memorability, and Efficiency. This has to do with just how long the webpage is. There are times at which one would
          need to go back and forth between the start and end of the entire page multiple times. For example,
          imagine if your pathways were Systems and Computational Biology, you would be scrolling across the
          entire page multiple times when trying to consider the courses you'd like to take while 
          also making sure you are not breaking any rules.

          WAVE found no errors and just one contrast error. The contrast error had to do with the
          low resolution (since it has probably not been updated in years) header that this page had. The alerts
          virtually all had to do with small text and it essentially tagged every bit of text on the page. 
          This is a valid concern. The majority of other alerts had to do with miscellaneous missing alt texts
          on images, however, none of those images were actually displayed, or the images were simply square 
          white blocks atop a white background so it is unclear why those assets are even present.

        <h3>Visual Design Style Guide</h3>
        <p>The following visual design style guide acts as documentation that makes my design work more consistent
          and makes handoffs to developers easier. This document displays the main colors, typography, and reusable 
          components’ different states that I will be using when transitioning my low-fidelity wireframes to
          high-fidelity prototypes. A big part of what I tried to do with this visual design style guide and with
          my high-fidelity prototypes was to mimic the design language embodied in some of Brown's newer updated
          websites such as the <a href="https://www.brown.edu" target="_blank">Brown home page</a> as well as <a href="https://www.brown.edu/undergraduate_concentrations" target="_blank">Focal Point</a>.
          A small caveat that goes with this disclaimer is that at least in this visual design style guide, 
          I primarily focus on micmicking colors, font styles and sizes, and the default base state of elements. 
          Many elements on Brown's websites have animations that transition them to active states that I have
          not covered in my design guide since I have not used those transitions in my prototypes and/or website.

          The annotations are meant to aid developers with simply taking these Figma prototype 
          files and reproducing them without much additional explanation. The visual design style guide, in combination
          with details within the Figma files should suffice to provide information on colors and font choices so the 
          annotations primarily focus on suggested elements and layout choices (i.e., CSS attributes like "display: flex"
          or "flex-direction" or substantial margin/padding etc.) as well as how the website is supposed to behave when
          in-between screen sizes.

          translation of the Figma prototypes. Nothing on the webpages are actually functional yet, primarily
          because the assignment prohibits the use of Javascript. I will probably eventually make it functional
          and maybe even publicly launch the website (provided Brown allows it since I am using their design
          language). I have thoroughly tested its responsiveness in Chrome using the Responsive mode (as seen below), an iPad Air/Pro, and
          an iPhone 12 Pro in the Chrome simulator.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          To summarize this process, I would say that it has been, interesting. I think I approached this assuming it would be
          fairly easy and straightforward. However, I've come to realize that if something looks appealing, it has almost
          ceratinly been intentionally designed. As I tried to replicate the design language of Brown's newer websites,
          which I always considered to be more aethetically pleasing, I realized how much effort had gone into it. There 
          were so many small animations, and color choices, font sizes and styles etc. that went into making it look good
          and feel usable. I hope I was able to capture some of that and bring it to a Brown webpage that had not yet received
          that same treatment yet is one that is dear to me (even if only based on the number of times I've visited it).
