        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The following article walks you through the process of analyzing and identifying
          usability flaws in an existing interface, creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes 
          for various screen sizes, and building a responsive website based on those prototypes.

        <h3>Selecting an Interface</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to pick an interface that I knew very well and used quite often so that the 
          effort I would be putting into redesigning it would be well worth it and so that I had
          a sufficiently large dataset of usability concerns that I could try to solve.

        <h4>The New User's Usability Concerns</h4>
        <p>
          This is someone who is either considering applying to Brown or a first/second year 
          student who wants to look at the expected workload for the Computer Science concentration.
          Learnability, i.e., how easy is the interface to use, is their primary concern. However, 
          the current concentration requirements webpage does not do a great job of addressing this 
          or working with the conceptual model of someone trying to understand the expected workload 
          for the Computer Science concentration.

          This is a Brown student who is bored and wants to get a sense of what the 
          Computer Science concentration workload is like or a newly declared student who 
          doesn’t yet care too much about requirements.  Memorability, i.e., how easy is 
          it to recall what to do, is their primary concern.  However, the current concentration
          requirements webpage does not do a great job of addressing this or working with the 
          conceptual model of someone just occasionally visiting the website.

        <p>
          This is a Brown student who is a declared Computer Science concentrator. They have 
          visited the website many times and know how to get around. Their primary purpose is
          to see both how many credits they need as well as what those credits can be and they
          will use this as a single source of truth. However, the current concentration requirements
          webpage does not do a great job of addressing this or working with the conceptual model of 
          someone trying to make sure they will graduate on time.

          WAVE found no errors and just one contrast error. The contrast error had to do with the
          low resolution (and probably not been updated in years) header that this page had. The alerts
          virtually all had to do with small text and it essentially tagged every bit of text on the page. 
          This is a valid concern. The majority of other alerts had to do with miscellaneous missing alt texts
          on images, however, none of those images were actually displayed, or the images were simply square 
          white blocks atop a white background so it is unclear why those assets are even present.

          Izzy is an introvert and likes to avoid unnecessary human interaction when possible. They normally go
          up to the counter but get nervous and feel awkward about wasting the cashier’s time and order the 
          standard drink which they don’t actually enjoy. They are reluctant to ask for help when they are not
          able to figure something out and get flustered very easily. So, they are very happy about being able
          to use an automated kiosk to order instead of doing so at the counter and take their own sweet time 
          while feeling very comfortable.

          Frank is short tempered and not having a good day. Already frustrated, they come to the cafe for a 
          drink to cool off; but every part of the process seems to not work as it should, frustrating them 
          even further. They just want to get out of there as fast as they can but they are not able to. They
          don't read any of the instructions and try to speed through the process while also pressing harder
          than they should on the touchscreen causing glitches. They are unhappy about the bilingual nature
          of the menu and the resulting lack of clarity on certain menu items. The lack of explanation on
          the rewards process and the fact that they are spending so much time on this all contributes to
          an unpleasant experience.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>To summarize this process, I think it's clear that personas and storyboards are powerful 
          tools that help capture the intricaies and nuances of a user experience in a way that simpler
          tools like user roles, market segments etc. simply cannot do. Automation in industries like 
          food are often touted as an unnecessary evil and articles like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-self-checkout-is-and-has-always-been-the-worst-1833106695">this one</a> 
          explain why it could be, as it was for Frustrated Frank, but hopefully Introverted Izzy was
          a good example of why it could be a blessing to some as well.</p>
